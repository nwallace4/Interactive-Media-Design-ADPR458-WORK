              <h2 class="pic1h2">
                  This team finished 11-0-1. The Huskers won the National Title on New Years Day when they defeated LSU 17-12. This was able to happen because top ranked Texas and second ranked Ohio State were both upset. Early on they had a tie with USC, but managed to get through the entire Big 8 with no issues. Some final polls were taken before bowl games, causing the Huskers to split the National Title with Texas and Ohio State.
