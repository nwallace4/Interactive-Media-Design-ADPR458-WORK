              </h1>
              <p class="pic1h2">
                This team is considered the best team ever in college football history by many. They went 12-0 while never having a close game. They defeated teams by an average score of 49-18 and beat four teams ranked in the Top 10. Tom Osborne coached this team. The Cornhuskers scored 638 points while only allowing 174. This means they won games by an average score of 53-14. In the National Championship, they defeated the Florida Gators by a score of 62-24.

              </h1>
              <p class="pic1h2">
                This team was 13-0. They were considered the best team of all time until the 1995 Nebraska Team came around. Their only close game was the "Game of the Century" to #2 ranked Oklahoma. This team was coached by Bob Devaney, who was in his 10th year. They outscored their opponents 507-114 throughout the entire season (13 games). Nevertheless, they defeated the number 2, 3, and 4 teams in the final polls.

              </h1>
              <p class="pic1h2">
                After an undefeated season and losing the National Championship by a field goal the year before, this season had a lot of pressure. They named the 1994 offseason as "unfinished business". The Huskers were returning their star quarterback and many other key defensive players. This team ended the season going 13-0. They managed to figure out ways to win even after losing star players Tommie Frazier and Mike Minter. They scored 459 points on offense while allowing just 162 points defensively. Their last game was a 24-17 victory over Miami in the Orange Bowl, claiming a National Championship.

                  4. 1997 Nebraska Football Team
              </h1>
              <p class="pic1h2">
                This team was extraordinary because it happened to be the last team Tom Osborne would coach at Nebraska. They went 13-0, defeating two teams in the top 8 by an average score of 49-21. This offense led the country in scoring. It was managed by quarterback Scott Frost and running back Ahman Green. Frost ran for over 1,000 yards while Green ended with 1,877 rushing yards. Out of the 20 NCAA championship selectors, 13 selected Nebraska, 6 selected Michigan, and one declared them co-champions. They split the National Title with Michigan. Many think it was due to the close victory of 45-38 over Missouri during the season. It remains one of the biggest National Championship debates in college football to this day.

              </h1>
              <p class="pic1h2">
                This team finished 11-0-1. The Huskers won the National Title on New Year's Day when they defeated LSU 17-12. This was able to happen because top-ranked Texas and second-ranked Ohio State were both upset. They had a tie with USC early on but managed to get through the entire Big 8 with no issues. Unfortunately, some final polls were taken before bowl games, causing the Huskers to split the National Title with Texas and Ohio State.
