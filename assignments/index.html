<h2>About Me</h2> 

<p>I am from Omaha,Nebraska. I went to a junior college in Coffeyville, Kansas where I played baseball for two years. 
    I then transfered back to Nebraska-Lincoln to finish up school, which worked out well considering I have aways been a big Nebraska fan. </p>
<h2>Classes This Semester</h2>
<P>-History of Rock Music
    -Interactive media Design
    -Multicultural Public Relations
    -Mass Media Law
</P>
<h2>Outside of class</h2>
<p>Things I enjoy to do outside fo class would be wathing sports, lifting weights, hanging out with friends and playing golf. I would say I occasionly play video games as well, but not too often. </p>
<h2>After Graduation</h2>
<p>I plan on going to work for my family friends collisiona nd repair center for s couple years. This will allow me to make good money while Im just starting out until I have enough money saved up to start something I want to. The goal is to have my own company and it will more than likely be dealing with something along the lines of manual labor.</p>
