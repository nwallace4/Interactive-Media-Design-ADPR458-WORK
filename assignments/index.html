<h3>About Me</h3> 

<p>I am from Omaha,Nebraska. I went to a junior college in Coffeyville, Kansas where I played baseball for two years. 
    I then transfered back to Nebraska-Lincoln to finish up school, which worked out well considering I have aways been a big Nebraska fan. </p>
<h3>Classes This Semester</h3>
<ul><li>History of Rock Music</li>
  <li>Interactive media Design</li>
  <li> Public Relations</li>
  <li>Mass Media Law</li ></ul>

<h3>Outside of class</h3>
<p>Things I enjoy to do outside fo class would be wathing sports, lifting weights, hanging out with friends and playing golf. I would say I occasionly play video games as well, but not too often. </p>
<h3>After Graduation</h3>
<p>I plan on going to work for my family friends collisiona nd repair center for s couple years. This will allow me to make good money while Im just starting out until I have enough money saved up to start something I want to. The goal is to have my own company and it will more than likely be dealing with something along the lines of manual labor.</p>
