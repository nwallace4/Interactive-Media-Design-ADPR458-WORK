    1. Tom Osborne
</h1>
<h2 class="pic1h2">
Tom was the Head Coach at Nebraksa from 1973-1997. He managed to rack up an impressive record of 255-49-3. Early on he faced various critics for his inability to win big games. He never won less than 9 games a season throughout his 25 years at Nebraska. He won National Championships in 1994, 1995, and 1997. He is still very beloved in the State of Nebraka and still has a say in what goes on with Nebraska football today.
