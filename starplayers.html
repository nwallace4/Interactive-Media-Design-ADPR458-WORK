                Mike Rozier was a historical running back for Nebraska from 1981 to 1983, allowing the Huskers to go 33-5 during his time there. He only played three seasons, but Rozier is the all-time leading rusher at Nebraska. He managed to rack up 4,780 rushing yards while only playing 35 games, an average of 136 yards per game. Rozier has the record for most 100-yard rushing games (26), most 200-yard rushing games (7), the most touchdowns (52), and most points by a single player (312). When Rozier was a senior in 1983, he had his best season yet. He was the consensus National Player of the Year, a first-team All-American, and won the Heisman Trophy (best player in college football). Rozier ran for 2,148 yards in his senior season. At the time, that was the second-highest total in NCAA history.

At the start of this season, he had started 23 consecutive games with a 20-3 record, competing in two Orange Bowls. After starting out 4-0, he was sidelined due to issues with blood clots in his leg.
